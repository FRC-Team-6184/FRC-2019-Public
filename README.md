# Leon Robotics GitHub
## Frc switched to gradle so this is not backwards compatable

We're a homemade, nonprofit FIRST Robotics Competition team from Leon High School in Tallahassee, Florida. Our team is made up of high 
school age members, adult mentors, and an array of amazing sponsors. Primarily, our organization's goal is to cultivate members' 
critical thinking and collaborative skills by providing an avenue in which programmers, designers, artists, and builders can channel 
their ideas and creativity into the field of STEM. We want to help build the visionaries and leaders of tomorrow. -- taken off our website

This GitHub is designed to display our seasonal code and display it to the public and anyone who is interested. Along with any other
experimental personal projects, such as making a robot follow at a distance based solely on vision feedback. 

My name is Nick I ran the programming team at Leon robotics (2017-2019), if anyone has general questions or is interested in joining our team, feel free to the link below.

if there are any requests for something that isn’t available on the GitHub send it to Leonroboticsteam@gmail.com.
Thank you!
